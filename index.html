<p class="center">
    Hey there! I’m Stephanie Perea—a self-proclaimed tech enthusiast, perpetual learner, and lover of all things nerdy.
    With my trusty glasses perched on my nose and my long hair ready to tackle the next adventure,
    I dive deep into the tech world, one digital byte at a time!
</p>
<br><br>

<p class="center">
        When I’m not experimenting with the latest gadgets or figuring out techy tricks,
    you can probably find me either devouring a book on coding (or any shiny new thing),
    or just lost in thought, daydreaming about all the ways technology will take us to Mars.
    I believe in the power of tech to make life better and am on a mission to spread that joy—and maybe a bit of laughter—along the way.
</p>

    So, if you’re into learning new stuff and want to keep it light-hearted,
    you’re in the right place. Welcome to my corner of the internet!
